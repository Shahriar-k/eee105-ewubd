<h3><strong>Course&nbsp;</strong>content</h3>

<p>Introduction to computers and programming languages, data representation in computer, algorithms and flowchart construction for problem solving. Introduction to programming (input, output, variables, data types, operators, expressions, assignments). Conditional, control statements, and loops (if, if-else, switch, while, for etc.). Introduction to arrays (declaring and manipulating arrays of numbers and characters, strings) and multi-dimensional arrays. Introduction to functions (definitions, prototypes, argument, header files). Application of user defined functions. Pointers: variable declarations, operators, passing arguments to functions, pointer arithmetic and function pointers. Object oriented programming: introduction, class, object and method.</p>

<p>The course includes lab works for implementation of the concepts learned.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Course rationale</strong></h3>

<p>Programming skills are necessary in many areas of electrical &amp; electronic engineering, such as â€“ numerical analysis, signal processing, control systems analysis and design, microprocessor-based systems design, embedded systems design etc. Therefore, programming has become an inextricable part of electrical &amp; electronic engineering. This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of programming, algorithm development and problem solving, data types, control structures, functions, arrays etc., as well as program testing, and debugging.</p>

<h3>Course objectives</h3>

<p>The objectives of the course are to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Develop the ability to write pseudo codes, flow charts effectively to solve problems</li>
	<li>Enable the students to use appropriate conditionals, iteration constructs, control structures, and functions to solve programming tasks</li>
	<li>Enable the students to use memory addressing techniques and data structures in programming</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to write and debug programs to solve practical problems</li>
	<li>Enable students to use object-oriented programming techniques to solve problems</li>
</ol>

<h3>Course outcomes</h3>

<p>A student successfully completing this course will be able to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Develop algorithms, pseudo codes, and flowcharts in a logical manner to solve problems</li>
	<li>Implement appropriate conditionals, iteration constructs, control structures, and functions to solve programming tasks</li>
	<li>Apply data structures and memory addressing techniques in programming</li>
	<li>Write and debug programs to solve practical problems</li>
</ol>
